## Hi there, I'm Pamudi Abeykoon! ğŸ‘‹
### A mindful designer who codes â€” crafting quiet, beautiful digital experiences.

ğŸŒ¿I craft web and mobile experiences with simplicity at their core â€” where form flows into function, and every detail carries quiet intention.

- ğŸ”­ Currently building: Apps that are simple, elegant, and built to scale â€” where design meets functionality.

- ğŸŒ± Always exploring: UI/UX design, interaction patterns, animations, and turning complex ideas into intuitive interfaces.

- ğŸ’Œ Say hi: Whether itâ€™s design, code, or just chatting about your favorite app â€” Iâ€™d love to connect!
